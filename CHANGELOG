Data file format was changed in the last two days.
The eye data is not accurately saved in the main datafile
at full resolution.. this entailed some minor file format
changes..

I think the datafile format has now essentially
stabilized and should be documented now..
  ** except for PHOTODIODE and SPIKE data!!

Moved SDL under the src try -- in ./src: make sdl to build
and install. Modified pype and pypenv shell scripts to put
./lib/lib on the LD_LIBRARY_PATH var so the private SDL libs
get called first..

File format is now REALLY stable.. photodiode and spike
data are being properly saved.  'pypedata' modules exists
for easy extraction of data..

Directories have been reorganized a bit to make install
generally easier on a non-jamie configured system..
