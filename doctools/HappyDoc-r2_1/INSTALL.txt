Installing HappyDoc

  HappyDoc uses the Distutils package for installation.  Unpack the
  tarball downloaded from SourceForge in a temporary directory.  Then
  run::

    % python ./setup.py install

  to install the package.

  !!! WARNING !!!

    Before installing HappyDoc 2.0+, any version earlier than 2.0 must
    be removed.  This includes the file 'happydoc.pth' and directory
    'happydoc' in site-packages, as well as the executable 'happydoc'
    in the 'bin' directory.
