Documentation Sets

    The documentation set, or *docset*, defines the structure of the
    collected documentation being generated.  All aspects of the
    structure are left up to the docset.  Whether to use multiple or a
    single file, a file or a database, and what specific metadata to
    include in the output is left up to the docset.  The docset drives
    the documentation generation using controls available from the
    formatter.
