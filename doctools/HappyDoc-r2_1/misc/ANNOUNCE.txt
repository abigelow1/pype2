Announcing the latest version of HappyDoc, a Python documentation extraction tool.

  HappyDoc is a tool for extracting documentation from Python source
  code.  It differs from other such applications by the fact that it
  uses the parse tree for a module to derive the information used in
  its output, rather that importing the module directly.  This allows
  the user to generate documentation for modules which need special
  context to be imported.

  More details are available on the HappyDoc home page at
  http://happydoc.sourceforge.net.

  !!! NOTICE !!!

    Before installing HappyDoc 2.0+, any version earlier than 2.0 must
    be removed.  This includes the file 'happydoc.pth' and directory
    'happydoc' in site-packages, as well as the executable 'happydoc'
    in the 'bin' directory.

  Version 2.1 -- 

    The primary reason for this release is to resolve the infamous *-d
    bug*.

    - **New Features**

      - #514237 - The PluginLoader no longer requires a '.py'
        extension on plugins.  This should allow plugins to be written
        in any language for which Python can load a module, and as
        long as the file is named with the right convention they will
        be picked up and loaded.  (The source of this change request
        was the maintainers of the PLD Linux Distribution.)

    - **Bug Fixes**

      - Resolved defect #513850, where output was written to the wrong
        place when the -d option was used.  

        **NOTE** *The solution to this problem resulted in changes to
        the file names being used for output.  It is recommended that
        a new directory be used to generate documentation for existing
        code, rather than trying to write over the top of existing
        files.*

      - Resolved defect #510447, a problem with escaping special
        characters in HTML output.  Text enclosed in single quotes
        is now not escaped in output so that HTML text can be 
        passed directly to the output file.

      - Fixed a problem with Windows installation using 'setup.py'.

    - **Other Changes**

      - Minor tweaks to the build and test tools.
